# Module: tdd-samples, Package: samples 

Purpose: To provide simple examples of various unit tests. 

Under ```src/main/java```, class Calc provides a trivial SUT (system under test). It has a single method named _sum()_ that takes a list of Doubles and sums them.

Class ```LoadAndSortList``` represents code one might write to read lines from a file and load each line into a Java List object, then sort the values and return the sorted List. In keeping with the software design principle, Separation of Concerns, the code in this class does not "know about" files; it only performs the processing for each record. 

Class ```Exception1``` can throw exceptions. Test class ```Exception1Test``` demonstrates ways to check that the expected exception was thrown and the exception message is as expected.

Under ```src/test/java``` there are a few unit test examples. Note that the test classes for Calc are intentionally designed to show a test failure (except the PBT example), so you can see how that looks. 

Under ```src/integrationTest/java``` there is a sample integration test written with JUnit. This is not the sort of microtest you would write for TDD, but it is provided for reference. 

## Class CalcCheck

```CalcCheck``` can be executed as a main program. It contains two microtests, both coded in method _runTests()_. This class illustrates an approach to writing microtests without the use of a unit testing library or framework. 

Learning goal: Get a sense of how to check the functionality of a method "by hand." 

## Class CalcTest 

```CalcTest``` is a typical JUnit test class. It contains two test methods that perform the same functional checks as the code in class ```CalcCheck```. 

Learning goal: Get a basic sense of how a unit testing library can simplify the task of writing microtests, and make the examples easier to read and understand. It illustrates the use of the JUnit annotation, @Test, which tells JUnit that a method is meant to be treated as a test case.

## Class CalcRefactoredTest 

This is the same as ```CalcTest``` after some basic refactoring was performed to reduce duplication. It illustrates another JUnit annotation, @BeforeEach, that causes the annotated method to be executed before each test case.

Learning goal: Gain a basic sense of how refactoring can simplify the design, reduce the number of lines of code, and enhance readability of the test suite.

## Class CalcParameterizedTest 

This is another refactored version of ```CalcTest```. It illustrates a parameterized test, also known as a data-driven test. The parameterized test performs the same functional checks as the other versions of ```CalcTest```. 

Learning goal: See how a parameterized test can reduce a number of separate test cases that are structurally the same, and differ only in their inputs and expected output, into a single test method. 

## Class CalcPropertyTest 

TDD is normally done using example-based test cases. Property Based Testing (PBT) is another approach to unit testing that can be applied to TDD, or to after-the-fact checking. PBT is out of scope for the course, but this example is provided to give you a basic idea of how it looks.

Learning goal: Awareness of PBT for future reference. 

## Class Exception1Test 

This class illustrates how to assert that the SUT throws the expected exception when passed certain input values, and to assert the exception message is as expected. 

Learning goal: See how to check for exceptions.

## Class LoadAndSortListTest 

This class illustrates how to define and use a _mock_ with one of the popular mocking libraries for Java, Mockito. Other mocking libraries support similar functionality. 

Learning goal: See how to check the functionality of a method that depends on a collaborator to provide access to an external data source, such as a file, without introducing a dependency on that data source to the test suite. 

The mock stands in for a BufferedReader instance that would probably be connected to a file in "real life." We are not checking the functionality of the file system, so we don't want the test case to be subject to failures due to file issues.
